# data-digestion

A collection of Clojure code for digesting data from APIs, downloads, etc. Final output TBD but it'll probably involve MySQL, JSON, and TSV.


destiny.clj - Downloads Star Wars Destiny game data from api. 
              Makes local copy of all JSON data.
              Exports files containing useful (to me) subsets of that data.
